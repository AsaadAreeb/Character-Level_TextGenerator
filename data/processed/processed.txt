ladies and gentlemen i cordially thank you with the utmost sincerity for the honour you have conferred upon me the greatest honour that it is possible for this sovereign assembly to confer by electing me as your first president
i also thank those leaders who have spoken in appreciation of my services and their personal references to me
i sincerely hope that with your support and your co operation we shall make this constituent assembly an example to the world
the constituent assembly has got two main functions to perform
the first is the very onerous and responsible task of framing our future constitution of pakistan and the second of functioning as a full and complete sovereign body as the federal legislature of pakistan
we have to do the best we can in adopting a provisional constitution for the federal legislature of pakistan
you know really that not only we ourselves are wondering but i think the whole world is wondering at this unprecedented cyclonic revolution which has brought about the plan of creating and establishing two independent sovereign dominions in this sub continent
as it is it has been unprecedented there is no parallel in the history of the world
this mighty sub continent with all kinds of inhabitants has been brought under a plan which is titanic unknown unparalleled
and what is very important with regards to it is that we have achieved it peacefully and by means of a revolution of the greatest possible character
dealing with our first function in this assembly i cannot make any well considered pronouncement at this moment but i shall say a few things as they occur to me
the first and the foremost thing that i would like to emphasise is this remember that you are now a sovereign legislative body and you have got all the powers
it therefore places on you the gravest responsibility as to how you should take your decisions
the first observation that i would like to make is this
you will no doubt agree with me that the first duty of a government is to maintain law and order so that the life property and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state
the second thing that occurs to me is this
one of the biggest curses from which india is suffering i do not say that other countries are free from it but i think our condition is much worse is bribery and corruption
hear hear
that really is a poison
we must put that down with an iron hand and i hope that you will take adequate measures as soon as it is possible for this assembly to do so
black marketing is another curse
well i know that black marketers are frequently caught and punished
according to our judicial notions sentences are passed and sometimes fines only are imposed
now you have to tackle this monster which today is a colossal crime against society in our distressed conditions when we constantly face shortage of food and or the essential commodities of life
a citizen who does black marketing commits i think a greater crime than the biggest and most grievous of crimes
these black marketers are really knowing intelligent and ordinarily responsible people and when they indulge in black marketing i think they ought to be very severely punished because they undermine the entire system of control and regulation of food stuffs and essential commodities and cause wholesale starvation and want and even death
the next thing that strikes me is this
here again is a legacy which has been passed on to us
along with many other things good and bad has arrived this great evil the evil of nepotism and jobbery
this evil must be crushed relentlessly
i want to make it quite clear that i shall never tolerate any kind of jobbery nepotism or any influence directly or indirectly brought to bear upon me
wherever i find that such a practice is in vogue or is continuing anywhere low or high i shall certainly not countenance it
i know there are people who do not quite agree with the division of indian and the partition of the punjab and bengal
much has been said against it but now that it has been accepted it is the duty of every one of us to loyally abide by it and honourably act according to the agreement which is now final and binding on all
but you must remember as i have said that this mighty revolution that has taken place is unprecedented
one can quite understand the feeling that exists between the two communities wherever one community is in majority and the other is in minority
but the question is whether it was possible or practicable to act otherwise than has been done
a division had to take place
on both sides in hindustan and pakistan there are sections of people who may not agree with it who may not like it but in my judgment there was no other solution and i am sure future history will record its verdict in favour of it
and what is more it will be proved by actual experience as we go on that that was the only solution of india s constitutional problem
any idea of a united india could never have worked and in my judgment it would have led us to terrific disaster
may be that view is correct may be it is not that remains to be seen
all the same in this division it was impossible to avoid the questions of minorities being in one dominion or the other
now that was unavoidable
there is no other solution
now what shall we do
now if we want to make this great state of pakistan happy and prosperous we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well being of the people and especially of the masses and the poor
if you will work in co operation forgetting the past burying the hatchet you are bound to succeed
if you change your past and work together in a spirit that every one of you no matter to what community he belongs no matter to what community he belongs no matter what relations he had with you in the past no matter what is his colour caste or creed is first second and last a citizen of this state with equal rights privileges and obligations there will be no end to the progress you will make
i cannot emphasise it too much
we should begin to work in that spirit and in course of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities the hindu community and the muslim community because even as regards muslims you have pathans punjabis shias sunnis and so on and among the hindus you have brahmins vashnavas khatris also bengalese madrasis and so on will vanish
indeed if you ask me this has been the biggest hindrance in the way of india to attain its freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free peoples long long ago
no power can hold another nation and specially a nation of millions souls in subjection no body could have conquered you and even if it had happened no body could have continued its hold on you for any length of time but for this
applause
therefore we must learn a lesson from this
you are free you are free to go to your temples you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this state of pakistan
you may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state hear hear
as you know history shows that in england conditions some time ago were much worse than those prevailing in india to day
the roman catholics and the protestants persecuted each other
even now there are some states in existence where there are discriminations made and bars imposed against a particular class
thank god we are not starting in those days
we are starting in the days when there is no discrimination no distinction between one community and another no discrimination between one caste or creed and another
we are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state
loud applause
the people of england in course of time had to face the realities of the situation and had to discharge the responsibilities and burdens placed upon them by the government of their country and they went through that fire step by step
today you might say with justice that roman catholics and protestants do not exist what exists now is that every man is a citizen an equal citizen of great britain and they are all members of the nation
now i think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time hindus would cease to be hindus and muslims would cease to be muslims not in the religious sense because that is the personal faith of each individual but in the political sense as citizens of the state
well gentlemen i do not wish to take up any more of your time and thank you again for the honour you have done to me
i shall always be guided by the principles of justice and fair play without any as is put in the political language prejudice or ill will in other words partiality or favouritism
my guiding principle will be justice and complete impartiality and i am sure that with your support and co operation i can look forward to pakistan becoming one of the greatest nations of the world
loud applause we are meeting today in our session after fifteen months
the last session of the all india muslim league took place at patna in december
since then many developments have taken place
i shall first shortly tell you what the all india muslim league had to face after the patna session of
you remember that one of the tasks which was imposed on us and which is far from completed yet was to organise muslim leagues all over india
we have made enormous progress during the last fifteen months in this direction
i am glad to inform you that we have established provincial leagues in every province
the next point is that in every bye election to the legislative assemblies we had to fight with powerful opponents
i congratulate the mussalmans for having shown enormous grit and spirit throughout our trials
there was not a single bye election in which our opponents won against muslim league candidates
in the last election to the u
p
council that is the upper chamber the muslim league s success was cent per cent
i do not want to weary you with details of what we have been able to do in the way of forging ahead in the direction of organising the muslim league
but i may tell you that it is going up by leaps and bounds
next you may remember that we appointed a committee of ladies at the patna session
it is of very great importance to us because i believe that it is absolutely essential for us to give every opportunity to our women to participate in our struggle of life and death
women can do a great deal within their homes even under purdah
we appointed this committee with a view to enable them to participate in the work of the league
the objects of this central committee were to organise provincial and district women s sub committees under the provincial and district muslim leagues to enlist a larger number of women to the membership of the muslim league to carryon an intensive propaganda amongst muslim women throughout india in order to create in them a sense of a greater political consciousness because if political consciousness is awakened amongst our women remember your children will not have much to worry about to advise and guide them in all such matters as mainly rest on them for the uplift of muslim society
this central committee i am glad to say started its work seriously and earnestly
it has done a great deal of useful work
i have no doubt that when we come to deal with their report of work done we shall really feel grateful to them for all the services that they have rendered to the muslm league
we had many difficulties to face from january right up to the declaration of war
we had to face the vidya mandir in nagpur
we had to face the wardha scheme all over india
we had to face ill treatment and oppression to muslims in the congress governed provinces
we had to face the treatment meted out to muslims in some of the indian states such as jaipur and bhavnagar
we had to face a vital issue that arose in that littlc state of rajkot
rajkot was the acid test made by the congress which would have affected one third of india
thus the muslim league had all along to face various issues from january up to the time of the declaration of war
before the war was declared the grratcst danger to the muslims of india was the possible inauguration of the federal scheme in the central government
we know what machinations were going on
but the muslim league was stoutly resisting them in every direction
we felt that we could never accept the dangerous scheme of the central federal government embodied in the government of india act
i am sure that we have made no small contribution towards persuading the british government to abandon the scheme of central federal government
in creating that state of mind in the british government the muslim league i have no doubt played no small part
you know that the british people are very obdurate people
they are also very conservative and although they are very clever they are slow in understanding
after the war was declared the viceroy naturally wanted help from the muslim league
it was only then that he realised that the muslim league was a power
for it will be remembered that up to the time of the declaration of war the viceroy never thought of me but of gandhi and gandhi alone
i have been the leader of an important party in the legislature for a considerable time larger than the one i have the honour to lead at present the present muslim league party in the central legislature
yet the viceroy never thought of me
therefore when i got this invitation from the viceroy along with mr
gandhi i wondered within myself why i was so suddenly promoted and then i concluded that the answer was the all india muslim league whose president i happen to be
i believe that was the worst shock that the congress high command received because it challenged their sole authority to speak on behalf of india
and it is quite clear from the attitude of mr
gandhi and the high command that they have not yet recovered from that shock
my point is that i want you to realise the value the importance the significance of organising ourselves
i will not say anything more on the subject
but a great deal yet remains to be done
i am sure from what i can see and hear that the muslim india is now conscious is now awake and the muslim league has by now grown into such a strong institution that it cannot be destroyed by anybody whoever he may happen to be
men may come and men may go but the league will live for ever
now coming to the period after the declaration of war our position was that we were between the devil and the deep sea
but i do not think that the devil or the deep sea is going to get away with it
anyhow our position is this
we stand unequivocally for the freedom of india
but it must be freedom of all india and not freedom of one section or worse still of the congress caucus and slavery of mussalmans and other minorities
situated in india as we are we naturally have our past experiences and particularly the experiences of the past years of provincial constitution in the congress governed provinces
we have learnt many lessons
we are now therefore very apprehensive and can trust nobody
i think it is a wise rule for every one not to trust anybody too much
sometimes we are led to trust people but when we find in actual experience that our trust has been betrayed surely that ought to be sufficient lesson for any man not to continue his trust in those who have betrayed him
ladies and gentlemen we never thought that the congress high command would have acted in the manner in which they actually did in the congress governed provinces
i never dreamt that they would ever come down so low as that
i never could believe that there would be a gentleman s agreement between the congress and the government to such an extent that although we cried ourselves hoarse week in and week out the governors were supine and the governor general was helpless
we reminded them of their special responsibilities to us and to other minorities and the solemn pledges they had given to us
but all that had become a dead letter
fortunately providence came to our help and that gentleman s agreement was broken to pieces and the congress thank heaven went out of office
i think they are regretting their resignations very much
their bluff was called off was called
so far so good
i therefore appeal to you in all the seriousness that i can command to organise yourselves in such a way that you may depend upon none except your own inherent strength
that is your only safeguard and the best safeguard
depend upon yourselves
that does not mean that we should have ill will or malice towards others
in order to safeguard your rights and interests you must create that strength in yourselves such that you may be able to defend yourselves that is all that i want to urge
now what is our position with regard to a future constitution
it is that as soon as circumstances permit or immediately after the war at the latest the whole problem of india s future constitution must be examined de novo and the act of must go once for all
we do not believe in asking the british government to make declarations
these declarations are really of no use
you cannot possibly succeed in getting the british government out of this country by asking them to make declarations
however the congress asked the viceroy to make a declaration
the viceroy said i have made the declaration
the congress said no no
we want another kind of declaration
you must declare now and at once that india is free and independent with the right to frame its own constitution by a constituent assemhly to be elected on the basis of adult franchise or as low a franchise as possihle
this assembly will of course satisfy the minorities legitimate mterests
mr
gandhi says that if the minorities are not satisfied then he is willing that some tribunal of the highest character and most impartial should decide the dispute
now apart from the impracticable character of this proposal and quite apart from the fact that it is historically and constitutionally absurd to ask a ruling power to abdicate in favour of a constituent assembly
apart from all that suppose we do not agree as to the franchise according to which the central assembly is to be elected or suppose the the solid body of muslim representatives do not agree with the non muslim majority in the constituent assembly what will happen
it is said that we have no right to disagree with regard to anything that this assemhly may do in framing a national constitution of this huge sub continent except those matters which may be germane to the safeguards for the minorities
so we are given the privilege to disagree only with regard to what may be called strictly safe guards of the rights and interests of minorities
we are also given the privilege to send our own representatives by separate electorates
now this proposal is based on the assumption that as soon as this constitution comes into operation the british hand will disappear
otherwise there will be no meaning in it
of course mr
gandhi says that the constitution will decide whether the british will disappear and if so to what extent
in other words his proposal comes to this first give me the declaration that we are a free and independent nation then i will decide what i should give you back
does mr
gandhi really want the complete independence of india when he talks like this
but whether the british disappear or not it follows that extensive powers must be transferred to the people
in the event of there being a disagreement between the majority of the constituent assembly and the mussalmans in the first instance who will appoint the tribunal
and suppose an agreed tribunal is possible and the award is made and the decision given who will may i know be there to see that this award is implemented or carried out in accordance with the terms of that award
and who will see that it is honoured in practice because we are told the british will have parted with their power mainly or completely
then what will be the sanction behind the award which will enforce it
we come back to the same answer the hindu majority would do it and will it be with the help of the british bayonet or the gandhi s ahinsa
can we trust them any more
besides ladies and gentlemen can you imagine that a question of this character of social contract upon which the future constitution of india would be based affecting million of mussalmans can be decided by means of a judicial tribunal
still that is the proposal of the congress
before i deal with what mr
gandhi said a few days ago i shall deal with the pronouncements of some of the other congress leaders each one speaking with a different voice
mr
rajagopalacharya the ex prime minister of madras says that the only panacea for hindu muslim unity is the joint electorates
that is his prescription as one of the great doctors of the congress organisation
laughter
babu rajendra prasad on the other hand only a few days ago said oh what more do the mussalmans want
i will read to you his words
referring to the minority question he says if britain would concede our right of self determination surely all these differences would disappear
how will our differences disappear
he does not explain or enlighten us about it
but so long as britain remains and holds power the differences would continue to exist
the congress has made it clear that the future constitution would be framed not by the congress alone but by representatives of all political parties and religious groups
the congress has gone further and declared that the minorities can have their representatives elected for this purpose by separate electorates though the congress regards separate electorates as an evil
it will be representative of all the peoples of this country irrespective of their religion and political affiliations who will be deciding the future constitution of india and not this or that party
what better guarantees can the minorities have
so according to babu rajendra prasad the moment we enter the assembly we shall shed all our political affiliations and religions and everything else
this is what babu rajendra prasad said as late as th march
and this is now what mr
gandhi said on the th of march
he says to me hindus muslims parsis harijans are all alike
i cannot be frivolous but i think he is frivolous i cannot be frivolous when i talk of quaid i azam jinnah
he is my brother
the only difference is this that brother gandhi has three votes and i have only one vote
laughter
i would be happy indeed if he could keep me in his pocket
i do not know really what to say of this latest offer of his
there was a time when i could say that there was no muslim whose confidence i did not enjoy
it is my misfortune that it is not so today
why has he lost the confidence of the muslims today
may i ask ladies and gentlemen
i do not read all that appears in the urdu press but perhaps i get a lot of abuse there
i am not sorry for it
i still believe that without hindu muslim settlement there can be no swaraj
mr
gandhi has been saying this now for the last years
you will perhaps ask in that case why do i talk of a fight
i do so because it is to be a fight for a constituent assembly
he is fighting the british
but may i point out to mr
gandhi and the congress that you are fighting for a constituent assembly which the muslims say they cannot accept which the muslims say means three to one about which the mussalmans say that they will never be able in that way by the counting of head to come to any agreenwnt which will be real agreement from the hearts which will enable us to work as friends and therefore this idea of a constituent assembly is objectionable apart from other objections
but he is fighting for the constituent assembly not fighting the mussalmans at all
he says i do so because it is to be a fight for a constituent assembly
if muslims who come to the constituent assembly mark the words who come to the constituent assembly through muslim votes he is first forcing us to come to that assembly and then says declare that there is nothing common between hindus and muslims then alone i would give up all hope but even then i would agree with them because they read the quran and i have also studied something of that holy book
laughter
so he wants the constituent assembly for the purpose of ascertaining the views of the mussalmans and if they do not agree then he will give up all hopes but even then he will agree with us
laughter
well i ask you
ladies and gentlemen is this the way to show any real genuine desire if there existed any to come to a settlement with the mussalmans
voices of no no
why does not mr
gandhi agree and
i have suggested to him more than once and i repeat it again from this platform why does not mr
gandhi honestly now acknowledge that the congress is a hindu congress that he does not represent anybody except the solid body of hindu people
why should not mr
gandhi be proud to say
i am a hindu
congress has solid hindu backing
i am not ashamed of saying that i am a mussalman
hear hear and applause
i am right and i hope and i think even a blind man must have been convinced by now that the muslim league has the solid backing of the mussalmans of india hear hear
why then all this camouflage
why all these machinations
why all these methods to coerce the british to overthrow the mussalmans
why this declaration of non cooperation
why this threat of civil disobedience
and why fight for a constituent assembly for the sake of ascertaining whether the mussalmans agree or they do not agree
hear hear
why not come as a hindu leader proudly representing your people and let me meet you proudly representing the mussalmans
hear hear and applause
this all that i have to say so far as the congress is concerned
so far as the british government is concerned our negotiations are not concluded yet as you know
we had asked for assurances on several points
at any rate we have made some advance with regard to one point and that is this
you remember our demand was that the entire problem of the future constitution of india should be examined de novo apart from the government of india act of
to that the viceroy s reply with the authority of his majesty s government was i had better quote that i will not put it in my own words this is the reply that was sent to us on the rd of december
my answer to your first question is that the declaration i made with the approval of his majesty s government on october the th last does not exclude mark the words does not exclude examination of any part either of the act of or of the policy and plans on which it is based
hear hear
as regards other matters we are still negotiating and the most important points are that no declaration should be made by his majesty s government with regard to the future constitution of india without our approval and consent hear hear and applause and that no settlement of any question should be made with any party behind our back hear hear unless our approval and consent is given to it
well ladies and gentlemen whether the british government in their wisdom agree to give us that assurance or not but
i trust that they will still see that it is a fair and just demand when we say that we cannot leave the future fate and the destiny of million of people in the hands of any other judge
we and we alone wish to be the final arbiter
surely that is a just demand
we do not want that the british government should thrust upon the mussalmans a constitution which they do not approve of and to which they do not agree
therefore the british government will be well advised to give that assurance and give the mussalmans complete peace and confidence in this matter and win their friendship
but whether they do that or not after all as i told you before we must depend on our own inherent strength and i make it plain from this platform that if any declaration is made if any interim settlement is made without our approval and without our consent the mussalmans of india will resist it
hear hear and applause
and no mistake should be made on that score
then the next point was with regard to palestine
we are told that endeavours earnest endeavours are being made to meet the reasonable national demands of the arabs
well we cannot be satisfied by earnest endeavours sincere endeavours best endeavours
laughter
we want that the british government should in fact and actually meet the demands of the arabs in palestine
hear hear
then the next point was with regard to the sending of the troops
here there is some misunderstanding
but anyhow we have made our position clear that we never intended and in fact language does not justify it if there is any misapprehension or apprehension that the indian troops should not be used to the fullest in the defence of our own country
what we wanted the british government to give us assurance of was that indian troops should not be sent against any muslim country or any muslim power
hear hear
let us hope that we may yet be able to get the british government to clarify the position further
this then is the position with regard to the british government
the last meeting of the working committee had asked the viceroy to reconsider his letter of the rd of december having regard to what has been explained to him in pursuance of the resolution of the working committee dated the rd of february and we are informed that the matter is receiving his careful consideration
ladies and gentlemen that is where we stand after the war and up to the rd of february
as far as our internal position is concerned we have also been examining it and you know
there are several schemes which have been sent by various well informed constitutionalists and others who take interest with are interested in the problem of india s future constitution and we have also appointed a sub committee to examine the details of the schemes that have come in so far
but one thing is quite clear it has always been taken for granted mistakenly that the mussalmans are a minority and of course we have got used to it for such a long time that these settled notions sometimes are very difficult to remove
the mussalmans are not a minority
the mussalmans are a nation by any definition
the british and particularly the congress proceed on the hasis well you are a minority after all what do you want
what else do the minorities want
just as babu rajendra prasad said
but surely the mussalmans are not a minority
we find that even according to the british map of india we occupy large parts of this country where the mussalmans are in a majority such as bengal punjab n
w
f
p
sind and baluchistan
now the question is what is the solution of this prohlem between the hindus and the mussalmans
we have been considering and as i have already said a committee has been appointed to consider the various proposals
but whatever the final scheme of constitution i will present to you my views and i will just read to you in confirmation of what i am going to put before you a letter from lala lajpat rai to mr
c
r
das
it was written i believe about or years ago and that letter has been produced in a book recently published by one indra prakash and that is how this letter has come to light
this is what lala lajpat rai a very astute politician and a staunch hindu mahasabite said
but before i read his letter it is plain from it that you cannot get away from being a hindu if you are a hindu
laughter
the word nationalist has now become the play of conjurers in politics
this is what he says there is one point more which has been troubling me very much of late and one about which i want you to think carefully and that is the question of hindu muhammadan unity
i have devoted most of my time during the last six months to the study of muslim history and muslim law and i am inclined to think it is neither possible nor practicable
assuming and admitting the sincerity of mohammadan leaders in the non cooperation movement i think their religion provides an effective bar to anything of the kind
you remember the conversation i reported to you in calcutta which i had with hakim ajmal khan and dr
kitchlew
there is no finer muhammadan in hindustan than hakim ajmal khan but can any muslim leader over ride the quran
i can only hope that my reading of islamic law is incorrect
i think his reading is quite incorrect
and nothing would relieve me more than to be convinced that it is so
but if it is right then it comes to this that although we can unite against the british we cannot do so to rule hindustan on british lines
we cannot do so to rule hindustan on democratic lines
ladies and gentlemen when lala lajpat rai said that we cannot rule this country on democratic lines it was all right but when i had the temerity to speak the same truth about eighteen months ago there was a shower of attacks and criticism
but lala lajpat rai said fifteen years ago that we cannot do so viz
rule hindustan on democratic lines
what is the remedy
the remedy according to congress is to keep us in the minority and under the majority rule
lala lajpat rai proceeds further what is then the remedy
i am not afraid of the seven crores million of mussalmans
but i think the seven crores in hindustan plus the armed hordes of afghanistan central asia arabia mesopotamia and turkey will be irresistible
laughter
i do honestly and sincerely believe in the necessity or desirability of hindu muslim unity
i am also fully prepared to trust the muslim leaders
but what about the injunctions of the koran and hadis
the leaders cannot over ride them
are we then doomed
i hope not
i hope your learned mind and wise head will find some way out of this difficulty
now ladies and gentlemen that is merely a letter written by one great hindu leader to another great hindu leader fifteen years ago
now i should like to put before you my views on the subject as it strikes me taking everything into consideration at the present moment
the british govemment and parliament and more so the british nation have been for many decades past brought up and nurtured with settled notions about india s future based on developments in their own country which has built up the british constitution functioning now through the houses of parliament and the system of the cabinet
their concept of party government functioning on political planes has become the ideal with them as the best form
of government for every country and the one sided and powerful propaganda which naturally appeals to the british has led them into a serious blunder in producing a constitution envisaged in the government of india act of
we find that the most leading statesmen of great britain saturated with these notions have in their pronouncements seriously asserted and expressed a hope that the passage of time will harmonise the inconsistent elements in india
a leading journal like the london times commenting on the government of india act of wrote that undoubtedly the difference between the hindus and muslims is not of religion in the strict sense of the word but also of law and culture that they may be said indeed to represent two entirely distinct and separate civilisations
however in the course of time the
superstitions will die out and india will be moulded into a single nation
so according to the london times the only difficulties are superstitions
these fundamental and deep rooted differences spiritual economic cultural social and political havc been euphemised as mere superstitions
but surely it is a flagrant disregard of the past history of the sub continent of india as well as the fundamental islamic conception of society vis a vis that of hinduism to characterise them as mere superstitions
notwithstanding a thousand years of close contact nationalities which are as divergent today as ever cannot at any time be expected to transform themselves into onc nation merely by means of subjecting them to a democratic constitution and holding them forcibly togdher by unnatural and artificial methods of british parliamentary statutes
what the unitary government of india for one hundred fifty years had failcd to achieve cannot be realiscd by the imposition of a central federal government
it is inconceivable that the fiat or the writ of a government so constituted can ever command a willing and loyal obedience throughout the sub continent by various nationalities except by means of armed force behind it
the problem in india is not of an inter communal character but manifestly of an international one and it must be treated as such
so long as this basic and fundamental truth is not realised any constitution that may be built will result in disaster and will prove destructive and harmful not only to the mussalmans but to the british and hindus also
if the british government are really in earnest and sincere to secure the peace and happiness of the people of this sub continent the only course open to us all is to allow the major nations separate homelands by dividing india into autonomous national states
there is no reason why these states should be antagonistic to each other
on the other hand the rivalry and the natural desire and efforts on the part of one to dominate the social order and establish political supremacy over the other in the government of the country will disappear
it will lead more towards natural goodwill by international pacts between them and they can live in complete harmony with their neighbours
this will lead further to a friendly settlement all the more easily with regard to minorities by reciprocal arrangements and adjustments between muslim india and hindu india which will far more adequately and effectively safeguard the rights and interests of muslim and various other minorities
it is extremely difficult to appreciate why our hindu friends fail to understand the real nature of islam and hinduism
they are not religions in the strict sense of the word but are in fact different and distinct social orders and it is a dream that the hindus and muslims can ever evolve a common nationality and this misconception of one indian nation has gone far beyond the limits and is the cause of more of our troubles and will lead india to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time
the hindus and muslims belong to two different religious philosophies social customs and literature s
they neither intermarry nor interdine together and indeed they belong to two different civilisations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions
their aspects perspectives
on life and of life are different
it is quite clear that hindus and mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history
they have different epics their heroes are different and different episode s
very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and likewise their victories and defeats overlap
to yoke together two such nations under a single state one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority must lead to growing discontent and final
destruction of any fabric that may be so built up for the government of such a state
history has presented to us many examples such as the union of great britain and ireland czechoslovakia and poland
history has also shown to us many geographical tracts much smaller than the sub continent of india which otherwise might have been called one country but which have been divided into as many states as there are nations inhabiting them
the balkan peninsula comprises as many as seven or eight sovereign states
likewise the portuguese and the spanish stand divided in the iberian peninsula
whereas under the plea of unity of india and one nation which does not exist it is sought to pursue here the line of one central government when we know that the history of the last twelve hundred years has failed to achieve unity and has witnessed during these ages india always divided into hindu india and muslim india
the present artificial unity of india dates back only to the british conquest and is maintained by the british bayonet but the termination of the british regime which is implicit in the recent declaration of his majesty s government will be the herald of the entire break up with worse disaster than has ever taken place during the last one thousand years under the muslims
surely that is not the legacy which britain would bequeath to india after one hundred fifty years of her rule nor would hindu and muslim india risk such a sure catastrophe
muslim india cannot accept any constitution which must necessarily result in a hindu majority government
hindus and muslims brought together under a democratic system forced upon the minorities can only mean hindu raj
democracy of the kind with which the congress high command is enamoured would mean the complete destruction of what is most precious in islam
we have had ample experience of the working of the provincial constitutions during the last two and a half years and any repetition of such a government must lead to civil war and the raising of private armies as recommended by mr
gandhi to the hindus of sukkur when he said that they must defend themselves violently or non violently blow for blow and if they could not they must emigrate mussalmans are not a minority as it is commonly known and understood
one has only got to look round
even today according to the british map of india out of eleven provinces four provinces where the muslims dominate more or less are functioning notwithstanding the decision of the hindu congress high command to non cooperate and prepare for civil disobedience
mussalmans are a nation according to any defmition of a nation and they must have their homelands their territory and their state
we wish to live in peace and harmony with our neighbours as a free and independent people
we wish our people to develop to the fullest our spiritual cultural economic social and political life in a way that we think best and in consonance with our own ideals and according to the genius of our people
honesty demands that we find and the vital interest s of millions of our people impose a sacred duty upon us to find an honourable and peaceful solution which would be just and fair to all
but at the same time we cannot be moved or diverted from our purpose and objective by threats or intimidations
we must be prepared to face all difficulties and consequences make all the sacrifices that may be required of us to achieve the goal we have set in front of us
ladies and gentlemen that is the task before us
i fear i have gone beyond my time limit
there are many things that i should like to tell you but i have already published a little pamphlet containing most of the things that i have said and i have been saying and i think you can easily get that publication both in english and in urdu from the league office
it might give you a clearer idea of our aims
it contains very important resolutions of the muslim league and various other statements
anyhow i have placed before you the task that lies ahead of us
do you realise how big and stupendous it is
do you realise that you cannot get freedom or independence by mere arguments
i should appeal to the intelligentsia
the intelligentsia in all countries in the world have been the pioneers of any movements for freedom
what does the muslim intelligentsia propose to do
i may tell you that unless you get this into your blood unless you are prepared to take off your coats and are willing to sacrifice all that you can and work selflessly earnestly and sincerely for your people you will never realise your aim
friends i therefore want you to make up your mind definitely and then think of devices and organise your people strengthen your organisation and consolidate the mussalmans all over india
i think that the masses are wide awake
they only want your guidance and your lead
come forward as servants of islam
organise the people economically socially educationally and politically and i am sure that you will be a power that will be accepted by everybody
cheers
this session of the all india muslim league
is one of the most critical that have taken place during its existence for the last more than thirty years
the policy and the programme that you are called upon to formulate and lay down involves the fate and the future of the musalmans of india and the country at large
on th april the muslim league at its session the first time in its history undertook the policy and programme of mass contact
the league considered the prevailing conditions and surveyed the situation as we had to face the forthcoming elections on the eve of the inauguration of the new provincial constitution embodied in the government of india act and had no alternative but to enter the field and contest the elections to the provincial legislatures
it was also felt that there was no alternative but to utilise the provincial constitution for what it was worth although it was far from being satisfactory
i may here reproduce the resolution that was passed on the th april whereas the parliamentary system of government which is being introduced in this country with the inauguration of the new constitution presupposes the formation of parties with a well defined policy and programme which facilitate the education of the electorate and co operation between groups with approximate aims and ideals and ensures the working of the constitution to the best advantage and whereas in order to strengthen the solidarity of the muslim community and to secure for the muslims their proper and effective share in the provincial governments it is essential that the muslims should organise themselves as one party with an advanced and progressive programme it is hereby resolved that the all india muslim league do take steps to contest the approaching provincial elections and for this purpose appoint mr
jinnah to form a central election board under his presidentship consisting of not less than membess with powers to constitute affiliate provincial election boards in various provinces having regard to the conditions of each province and devise ways and means for carrying out the aforesaid objects
in pursuance of that decision the muslim league central parliamentary board was established in june and also in various provinces provincial boards were established to give effect to the resolution and the instructions of the league
it was not without difficulty and it was no small task to be performed in the absence of any previous preparations or any existing efficient organisation and machinery
it was a stupendous undertakmg to contest elections in all the provinces especially when musalmans all over india are numerically in a minority and weak educationally backward and economically nowhere
there never had been made any systematic effort for their social and economic uplift
whereas our sister communities have gone far ahead with their organisations and the systematic programme supported by a large bulk of people especially the hindus who are not only in a majority but better trained more disciplined and far better equipped educationally economically and financially
but here i may mention that within a short time of about six months work before the elections were over the results were very hopeful and there is no need for us to despair
in each and every province where league parliamentary board was establlshed and the league parties were constituted we carried away about and per cent of the seats that were contested by the league candidates and since the elections were over i find that hundreds of district leagues have been established in almost every province from the farthest corner of madras to the north west frontier province
since april last the musalmans of india have rallied round the league more and more and i feel confident that once they understand and realise the policy and programme of the muslim league the entire musalman population of india will rally round its platform and under its flag
the muslim league stands for full national democratic self government for india
a great deal of capital is made as to phrases more for the consumption of the ignorant and illiterate masses
various phrases are used such as purna swaraj self government complete independence responsible government substance of independence and dominion status
there are some who talk of complete independence
but it is no use having complete independence on your lips and the government of india act in your hands
those who talk of complete independence the most mean the least what it means
was the gandhi irwin pact in consonance with complete independence
were the assurances that were required before the offices would be accepted and the provincial constitution could be worked consistent with purna swaraj and was the resolution after the assurance were refused accepting offices and working the provincial constitution enacted by the british parliament and forced upon the people of india by the imperialistic power in keeping with the policy and programme and the declarations of the congress party
does wrecking mean working
these paper declarations slogans and shibboleths are not going to carry us anywhere
what india requires is a complete united front and honesty of purpose and then by whatever name you may call your government is a matter of no consequence so long as it is a government of the people by the people for the people
the present leadership of the congress especially during the last ten years has been responsible for alienating the musalmans of lndia more and more by pursuing a policy which is exclusively hindu and since they have formed the governments in six provinces where they are in a majority they have by their words deeds and programme shown more and more that the musalmans cannot expect any justice or fair play at their hands
whenever they are in majority and wherever it suited them they refused to co operate with the muslim league parties and demanded unconditional surrender and signing of their pledges
the demand was insistent abjure your party and forswear your policy and programme and liquidate the muslim league but where they found that they had not a majority like the north west frontier province their sacred principle of collective responsibility disappeared and promptly the congress party was allowed in that province to coalesce with any other group
that then
any individual musalman member who was willing to unconditionally surrender and sign their pledge was offered a job as a minister and was passed off as a musalman minister although he did not command the confidence or the respect of an overwhelming majority of the musalman representatives in the legislature
these men are allowed to move about and pass off as muslim ministers for the loyal services they have rendered to the congress by surrendering and signing the pledge unconditionally and the degree of their reward is the extent of their perfidy
hindi is to be the nationall language of all india and the bande matram is to be the national song and is to be forced upon all
the congress flag is to be obeyed and revered by all and sundry
on the very threshold of what little power and responsibility is given the majority community have clearly shown their hand that hindustan is for the hindus only the congress masquerades under the name of nationalism whereas the hindu mahasabha does not mince words
the result of the present congress party policy will be i venture to say class bitterness communal war and strengthening of the imperialistic hold as a consequence
i dare say that the british government will give the congress a free hand in this direction and it matters very little to them nay on the contrary it is all to the good so long as their interests imperial or otherwise are not touched and the defence remains intact but i feel that a fearful reaction will set in when the congress has created more and more divisions amongst indians themselves and made the united front impossible
here it will not be out of place to state that the responsibility of the british government is no less in the disastrous consequences which issue ensue
it has been clearly demonstrated that the government and the governor general who have been given the powers and special responsibility to safeguard and protect the minorities under the constitution which was made so much of by lord zetland the secretary of state for india during the controversy of over the assurances demanded by the congress party have failed to use them and have thereby been a party they have been a party to passing off men as muslim ministers by appointing them as such although they know full well that they do not command the confidence of the muslim representatives or the public outside
if in a matter like this the governors have shown their utter helplessness and disregard for their sacred obligations which were assumed by the british government for the protection of minorities could they or would they be able to afford protection in a hundred and one other matters which may not come up to the surface to be known in the day to day working of the legislatures and the administrative machinery
these are very serious and not worthy signs of the time
the one wholesome lesson that i ask the musalmans to learn before it is too late is that the path before the musalmans is therefore plain
they must realise that the time has come when they should concentrate and devote their energies to self organisation and full development of their power to the exclusion of every other consideration
i have pointed out before that a section of musalmans is divided that there is a group that stands with face turned towards the british
if they have not learnt by now of the bitter consequences they will never learn
god only helps those who help themselves
there is another group which turns towards the congress and they do so because they have lost faith in themselves
i want the musalmans to believe in themselves and take their destiny in their own hands
we want men of faith and resolution who have the courage and determination and who would fight single handed for their convictions though at the moment the whole world may be against them
we must develop power and strength till the musalmans are fully organised and have acquired that power and strength which must come from the solidarity and the unity of the people
no settlement with the majority community is possible as no hindu leader speaking with any authority shows any concern or genuine desire for it
honourable settlement can only be achieved between equals and unless the two parties learn to respect and fear each other there is no solid ground for any settlement
offers of peace by the weaker party always mean confession of weakness and an invitation to aggression
appeals to patriotism justice and fair play and for good will fall flat
it does not require political wisdom to realise that all safeguards and settlements would be a scrap of paper unless they are backed up by power
politics means power and not relying only on cries of justice or fair play or good will
look at the nations of the world and look at what is happening every day
see what has happened to abyssinia look at what is happening to china and spain and not to say not to speak of the tragedy of palestine to which i shall refer later
the congress high command speaks in different voices
one opinion is that there is no such thing as the hindu muslim question and there is no such thing as the minorities question in the country
the other high opinion is that if a few crumbs are thrown to the musalmans in their present disorganised and helpless state you can manage them
they are sadly mistaken if they think that the musalmans can be imposed upon
the all india muslim league has now come to live and play its just part in the world of indian politics and the sooner this is realised and reckoned with the better it will be for all interests concerned
the third opinion is that there is no light to be seen through the impenetrable darkness but as the congress goes on acquiring strength and power so the past promises of the blank cheques remain unfilled and unsigned
i want the musalmans to ponder over the situation and decide their own fate by having one single definite uniform policy which should be loyally followed throughout india
the congressite musalmans are making a great mistake when they preach unconditional surrender
it is the height of a defeatist mentality to throw ourselves on the mercy and good will of others and the highest act of perfidy to the musalman community and if that policy is adopted let me tell you the community will seal its doom and will cease to play its rightful part in the national life of the country and the government
only one thing can save the musalmans and energise them to regain their lost ground
they must first recapture their own souls and stand by their lofty position and principles which form the basis of their great unity and which bind them in one body politic
do not be disturbed by the slogans and the taunts such as are used against the musalmans communalists toadies and reactionaries
the worst today on earth the most wicked communalist today amongst muslims when he surrenders unconditionally to the congress and abuses his own community becomes the nationalist of nationalists to morrow
these terms and words and abuses are intended to create an inferiority complex amongst the musalmans and to demoralise them and are intended to be sown in their midst and give us a bad name in the world abroad
this is the standard of propaganda which can only be treated with contempt
the all india muslim league certainly and definitely stands to safeguard the rights and interests of the musalmans and other minorities effectively
that is its basic and cardinal principle
this is the casus belli cause of war
that is why the muslim league and those who stand by it have incurred the displeasure of the congress for what why else are we doing what the congress objects to
they muslim league supporters are doing exactly what we decided two years ago
the league is not going to allow the musalmans to be exploited either by the british government or any other party or group inside the legislatures or outside
the congress with all its boasts has done nothing in the past for the musalmans
it has failed to inspire confidence and to create a sense of security amongst the musalmans and other minorities
the congress attempt under the guise of establishing mass contact with the musalmans is calculated to divide and weaken and break the musalmans and is an effort to detach them from their accredited leaders
it is a dangerous move and it cannot mislead anyone
all such manoeuvres will not succeed notwithstanding the various blandishments catchwords and slogans
the only honest and straightforward course is to give the minorities a fair deal
all talk of the hunger and poverty is intended to lead the people towards socialistic and communistic ideas for which india is far from prepared
the muslim league in the present conditions considers the policy of direct action as suicidal and futile
two such attempts have hitherto failed and have entailed untold misery and suffer ng to the people and it had to be wound up after two decades of persistent efforts in that direction with the result that a more reactionary constitution is forced upon the people and the congress is working under it now
to ask by a resolution the governor general to convey to the secretary of state for india to call a constituent assembly on the basis of adult franchise is the height of all ignorance
it shows lack of any sense of proportion
a constituent assembly can only be called by a sovereign authority and from the seat of power a special body of men chosen as the representatives with the authority of the sovereign to frame such constitution of the government of the country as they think proper and their function ceases and the constitution so framed by them would automatically take the place and function as the constitution of the government of the country
who is to constitute the electorates on the basis of adult franchise and how many representatives will be chosen by these electorates constituted on the basis of adult franchise and what will happen to the minorities in such constituencies and what will the electorates understand and how will they make their choice of this special body of men with final authority and power to frame the constitution of this great sub continent
who will direct the machinery to choose the special body of men with representative authority to frame such constitution as they may think proper
who will set in motion the machinery
and above all what will happen to the minorities in such a body
is the congress really serious that the secretary of state is going to carry out all these requirements when only a few days ago the representative of the british government speaking with the highest authority his excellency the viceroy said that he was full of hope that they might succeed in securing the federation of india in the near future that when he came out to india he had expressed the hope that the scheme of federation was on the whole one calculated to secure federation within a reasonable time after the inauguration of provincial autonomy and that his experience of the federation within a reasonable time
this last clause seems to be garbled
taking the country as a whole the congress is still far from occupying the seat of authority and it is a travesty of realities to think of the british government calling a constituent assembly and as for the ability of the congress to do so it is pure moonshine
let the congress first bring all principal communities in the country and all principal classes of interest under its leadership
to ask the foreign government who is the ruling and sovereign authority in this country to convene such a body before even the communal bodies in india have accepted the leadership of the congress is like putting the cart before the horse and not to do not forget that one third of indian india stands on a very special footing constituting the indian states and ruling princes
instead of ploughing the sands let the congress at least concentrate and see that the all india federation scheme embodied in the government of india act which is more reactionary than even the present central constitution is not brought into being as now it is so emphatically and confidently asserted by those who speak with authority on behalf of the british government that it is soon going to be inaugurated
what is the congress going to do
do they think that they can single handed as a party prevent it
or will some other formula be evolved and the congress quietly accept it as a fait accompli as it had done the provincial constitution in spite of all the rantings of some of the foremost leaders of the congress against it
may i now turn and refer to the question of palestine
it has moved the musalmans all over india most deeply
the whole policy of the british government has been a betrayal of the arabs from its very inception
fullest advantage has been taken of their trusting nature
great britain has dishonoured her proclamation to the arabs which had guaranteed to them complete independence of the arab homelands and the formation of an arab confederation under the stress of the great war
after having utilised them by giving them false promises they installed themselves as the mandatory power with that infamous balfour declaration which was obvioulsly irreconcilable and incapable of simultaneous execution and having pursued the policy to find a national home for the jews great britain now proposes to partition palestine and the royal commission s recommendation completes the tragedy and if given effect of to must necessarily lead to the complete ruination and destruction of every legitimate aspiration of the arabs in their homeland and now we are asked to look at the realities
but who created this situation
it has been the handiwork of and brought about sedulously by the british statesmen
the league of nations had it seems and let us hope not approved of the royal commission s scheme and a fresh examination may take place
but is it a real effort intended to give the arabs their due
may i point out to great britain that this question of palestine if not fairly and squarely met boldly and courageously decided is going to be the turning point in the history of the british empire
i am sure i am speaking not only of the musalmans of india but of the world and all sections of right thinking and fair minded people will agree when i say that great britain will be digging its grave if she fails to honour her original proclamation promises and intentions pre war and even post war which were so unequivocally expressed to
he arabs and the world at large
i find that a very tense feeling of excitement has been created and the british governrnent out of sheer desperation are resorting to repressive measures and ruthlessly dealing with the public opinion of the arabs in palestine
the muslims of india will stand solidly and will help the arabs in every way they can in their brave and just struggle that they are carrying on against all odds
may i send a message on behalf of the all india muslim league of cheer courage and determination in their just cause and struggle which i am sure they will win through
to the musalmans of india in every province in every district in every tahsil in every town i say your foremost duty is to formulate a constructive and ameliorative programme of work of for the people s welfare and to devise ways and means of social economic and political uplift of the musalmans
we shall not hesitate to co operate with any party or group in any practical and constructive programme for the welfare and advance of the provinces or the country
i entreat and implore that every man woman and child should rally round one common platform and flag of the all india muslim league
enlist yourselves by hundreds and thousands as quickly as you can as members of the all india muslim league provincial leagues and district leagues
organise yourselves establish your solidarity and complete unity
equip yourselves as trained and disciplined soldiers
create the feeling of esprit de corps and of comradeship amongst yourselves
no individual or people can achieve anything without industry suffering and sacrifice
there are forces which may bully you tyrannise over you and intimidate you and you may even have to suffer
but it is by going through this crucible of fire persecution which may be levelled against you tyranny that may be exercised the threats and intimidations that may unnerve you and it is by resisting by overcoming by facing these disadvantages and hardships and by suffering and maintaining your true convictions and loyalty that a nation will emerge worthy of its past glory and history and will live to make the future history greater and more glorious not only of india but in the annals of the world
eighty millions of musalmans in india have nothing to fear
they have their destiny in their hands and as a well knit solid organised united force can face any danger and withstand any opposition to its united front and wishes
there is the magic power in your own hands
take your vital decisions they may be grave and momentous and far reaching in their consequences
think a hundred times before you take any decision but once a decision is taken stand by it as one man
be true and loyal and i feel confident that success is with you
ladies and gentlemen in the first place let me thank you and those who have made inquiries about my indisposition
i have received so many messages and cards that it is not possible for me to reply to them personally either by wire or letter
but i hope that you will accept my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for your inquiries about my health
we have got to take stock of our internal progress and development of the organization of the all india muslim league
i think you will remember that the first foundation of the revival of the all india muslim league was laid down in april at bombay and it is now almost exactly five years
during the five years that have passed and if i may call it our five year plan we have i think it will be admitted by all hands succeeded in organizing the muslims of india from one end of india to the other in a remarkable manner
since the fall of the mogul empire i think i am right in saying that muslim india was never so well organized and so alive and so politically conscious as it is today
we have established a flag of our own a national flag of muslim india
we have established a remarkable platform that displays and demonstrates a complete unity of the entire solid body of muslim india
we have defined in the clearest language our goal about which muslim india was groping in the dark and the goal is pakistan
in this effort of ours let me not forget to appreciate what south india has done
i know you had many difficulties in your progress
i have been in very close touch with almost all the important districts of yours not personally but by means of post and telegrams
i have watched and i have watched with pride and pleasure the way in which you have organized the muslim league in south india
yours has been a real growth a growth not from the top but from the bottom
only about a year ago you exploded the top and brought the muslim league into complete harmony throughout your presidency
for this many have worked hard and i am in possession of reliable information
i believe i am not exaggerating to flatter you because i am in your presidency but i am convinced that percent of muslims in this vast presidency have organized themselves under the banner of the muslim league as no other province has done
that is our five year plan of the past
we have succeeded in raising the prestige of the league throughout this country it has now reached even the farthest corners of the world
now what s next
you must remember that we are now at the most critical time
you must remember that there are various forces in india and outside
no people can ever succeed in anything they desire unless they work for it and work hard for it
what is required now is that you should think and i say particularly to you delegates of the all india muslim league who have gathered here from all parts of india we must now think and devise the program of another five year plan
part of the five year plan should be how quickly and how best the departments of national life of muslim india can be built up
what are those departments
those are the four main pillars
let us devise a definite well considered educational plan
it was knowledge information and enlightenment that made a people great
next you know that muslims are left behind both economically and in the social uplift of the people of this great land of ours
muslims are at the bottom compared to other communities
consider this great province of madras
may i know what state the muslims have in the economic life of this province
maybe my knowledge is very poor but i have been inquiring since my arrival here and i have inquired before also
i was told that only two industries in which the muslims were anywhere were hides and skins and beedies in other words beedi sellers and matchstick sellers
i ask you are you going to be beedi sellers or matchstick sellers or are you going to play your part in the commerce and improvement of this presidency
the next important thing was political training
while the muslims had made remarkable progress in the sense that they had brought millions of muslims under the banner of the muslim flag while they had become politically conscious while they had come to feel that they had acquired their self respect self reliance and the dignity and honor of their nation they required thorough harnessing consolidating and political training in a manner that would enable them to march along to their goal
i want that there should be lieutenants captains majors colonels and generals and just as there are soldiers in the army we must have political soldiers
and these soldiers must be so well trained in political science that they could be prepared to face any emergency that might arise at any time
our decisions and our resolutions are misrepresented and misinterpreted
what is the goal of the muslim league
what is the ideology of the all india muslim league
let me tell you as clearly as i can
the goal of the all india muslim league is this we want the establishment of completely independent states in the north western and eastern zones of india with full control of defense foreign affairs communication customs currency exchange etc
and we do not want under the circumstances a constitution of an all india character with one government at the center
we will never agree to that
if you once agree let me tell you the muslims will be absolutely wiped out of existence
we shall never be a signatory to any power or government at the center so far as the north western and eastern zones of our free national homes are concerned
the leadership of hindu india i regret to say is being fooled and being bamboozled by the policy and diplomacy of the british government who are dangling in front of them a united all india constitution and democracy two carrots before donkeys
i say to the hindu leadership you have lost the last shred of statesmanship if you do not realize this yet
the british government knows that muslim india will never submit to an all india constitution with one central government and the british statesmen know that as far as democracy the parliamentary system of government is concerned it is nothing but a farce in this country
it is not as some people mix it up a question of muslims objecting to the government which should be based on the brotherhood of man as it is often said by people who truly do not understand what they are talking about when they discuss democracy or when they talk about islam
democracy means to begin with majority rule
majority rule in a single society is understandable although even there it has failed
representative government in a single nation harmonious homogeneous and unified is also understandable
but you only need to apply your mind for a few minutes to see the truth
can such a system ever work or succeed when you have two different nations and indeed more than two different nations in this subcontinent when you have two distinct societies the muslim society and the hindu society
and in this land south india there is another nation that is the dravidian
this land is truly dravidistan and imagine if three percent of the brahmin upper caste through skillful maneuvering and electioneering were to secure a majority
is this democracy or is this a farce
therefore i have my full sympathy and my fullest support for the non brahmins and i say to them the only way for you to live your own life is to live according to your own culture language and history
thank god that hindi did not gain a foothold here
go ahead
i have every sympathy and i shall do all i can and you can establish dravidistan where seven percent of the muslims will extend their hands of friendship and live with you in conditions of security justice and fairness
ladies and gentlemen in the first instance let me again thank you for the honor you have done me in asking me to preside over your deliberations in this conference of the punjab muslim students federation
as i said i felt that it was a call from a kindred spirit and i was only too glad to respond to that call
next i have been with you since the st of march that is yesterday and i have also watched your organization of this conference and your deliberations
let me most heartily congratulate you for the way in which you have organized this conference
i also wish to convey not only to the young men here but to a large body of muslims in lahore and those who have come from different parts that i really appreciate and feel happy that the muslims in punjab are now awake and that there is a small band of young men who have tried very hard to organize this conference of the punjab muslim students federation
but i think those who have worked for it those who have labored for it must have the fullest satisfaction that their labors have borne fruit and they are fully rewarded for their work
members of the punjab muslim students federation and ladies and gentlemen let me in the first instance as the president of the muslim league give you some account as short as possible of the work that the all india muslim league has done during the last three years
the muslim league as you know was in a moribund state in and the muslims were dead
bringing the last three years the muslim league has organized the muslims all over india to such an extent that it has been a matter not only of admiration but astonishment to those who are friends and those who are opponents
it is a remarkable thing when the history comes to be written how within these three years the bulk of million muslims rallied round one platform and under one flag a thing that you have never known in the history of the muslims for the last years
it seems almost like a miracle that such a thing could have happened
all our enemies all our opponents were fully confident and hoped in the idea that the muslims will never unite that they will quarrel and in that hope their mission was to incite and cause disruptions and divisions amongst the muslims
today let me tell you that they have now given up the efforts to create division and disruption amongst the muslims
i take only the latest instance of the rohilkhand constituency seat for the central assembly
they were told that it was the congress hold the hindu hold and that the last member who was elected was a muslim but a congressite muslim
well i never indulge in a language that would in any way convey that i take delight in the misfortune of anybody
the gentleman who was occupying the seat from the rohilkhand constituency i suppose could not help obeying the high command and had to perform individual satyagraha and as a result he was made the guest of his majesty s home laughter for more than one year and as a consequence which follows i mean the legal consequence he was unseated
but when we put up our candidate nawabzada liaqat ali khan there was no congressite to be seen either on the land or on the horizon
that is only one instance and there are many
but let us see what the muslim league has done
i believe i am correctly stating that today the muslim league has elevated the muslims of india to a position of dignity it has elevated the muslims of india to an honorable place in the affairs of this country and in the national life of this country
it has instilled in muslims both in rank and file a spirit of discipline
it has granted the muslims the much needed self respect and self reliance
it has provided muslim india with an accurate depiction mirrored before you a correct perspective of the critical issues that are currently impacting the muslim nation
therefore it has elevated the prestige and reputation of the muslims of india to an extent that has surpassed expectations my expectations and those of many of us
today muslim india is liberated from the clutches of bureaucracy
those individuals who were imposed upon the muslims as leaders and who paraded as leaders of the muslims but were inherently aligned with the bureaucratic camp have become powerless
those individuals who used to proudly wear the gandhi cap on the congress platform are now helpless and incapable of making any impact
the muslims have reclaimed their rightful place
they have united around their own platform and under their own flag and they are committed to pursuing their policies to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves
however there is still much more to accomplish and therefore my appeal to you whether young or old men or women is that we must continue to work
remember you have to achieve in the first instance the goal that you want muslim india to be under our government
you have to achieve that and achieving it cannot be accomplished merely by passing resolutions
you understand what this means
certainly we have proclaimed on numerous platforms that we are not a minority
that s correct we are not a minority
though it pains me to say this hindu leadership is still clinging to the outdated notion that we are a minority and they claim to be willing to provide safeguards based on principles outlined by the league of nations
today i read a formula from a prominent hindu leader who spoke at the hindu minorities conference happening in this city yesterday
let me tell my hindu friends and leaders that the league of nations is no longer relevant
do you not know this
let me enlighten you
you re living at least twenty five years in the past
moreover you fail to recognize that the global landscape is evolving rapidly week by week and month by month particularly in the european and other battlefronts
can this conservative and exclusive community not adapt modernize and shift its intentions and perspectives
yet it s as clear as day that we are not a minority we are a nation
and a nation requires a territory
what good is it to assert that we are a nation
a nation does not exist in the abstract it resides on land must govern that land and needs a territorial state exactly what you aim to achieve
keep in mind it s not a small endeavor
this is the most significant undertaking you ve ever embarked upon in your life since the decline of the mughal empire
you understand that this goal demands all the necessary components and preparation to be realized
please allow me to advise you do not get carried away by sentiments do not be swayed by slogans
how is a nation formed
and when it has faltered how is it revived
these are the crucial questions to consider
we fall into the category of the fallen
we ve witnessed the darkest days though i am heartened by the distinct and definitive revival and renaissance of the muslim nation in this country
thus we now find ourselves in a specific position
we re awakening
our eyes are just beginning to open
we ve gained that awareness as we look around
yet you are still an unwell individual you remain an invalid
you must traverse the convalescent phase before you can become entirely healthy robust and active
how do you bring your people to that stage of preparedness when you can achieve your goal
there is no effortless path
my young friends first and foremost you must engage in the nation building aspects
you may wonder what does that entail
what are these nation building aspects
allow me to elaborate on them
you can observe that there are at least three essential pillars that contribute to making a nation deserving of possessing a territory and governing its people
one is education
without education you find yourself in the same position as we were in this gathering last night in darkness
with education you ll be in the same position as you are in this broad daylight
additionally no nation and no populace can achieve much without becoming economically robust in commerce trade and industry
lastly once you ve gained the light of knowledge through education and have made yourselves economically commercially and industrially strong you must prepare yourselves for defense defense against external threats and the maintenance of internal security
hence these three main pillars form the foundation of a nation and the strength of the nation is directly related to your readiness and preparedness concerning these pillars
today you stand at the lower rungs of the ladder in these three key areas
educationally there s a substantial gap to bridge
economically and financially muslims across india are struggling on the brink of bankruptcy
even in terms of defense the muslims are notably underrepresented despite the limited opportunities under the present governmental system
therefore my young friends i observe that you have a set of resolutions commendable resolutions indeed
you aim to address some of these issues with your community
here s a program for you don t merely speak in a language of bravado or arrogance
i am convinced that we have no need for such talk nor do we need to resort to threats
why
first and foremost our cause is honest just and right
that s the initial reason
the second reason is that those who are strong and those who possess self confidence and self reliance do not need to engage in unnecessary threats or use arrogant language
let us therefore try as far as possible to reason and persuade our opponents
of course i understand that our reasoning and persuasion do not always succeed but we must exert every possible effort
let us not cultivate unnecessary bitterness against those who currently oppose this lahore pakistan resolution
why should we
i am confident that these opponents of ours will eventually recognize that this is the only and best solution for india s immensely complex problem a problem that stands without parallel in the world
whether they are our opponents the british government the indian princes or the hindus all these significant and essential elements within the indian subcontinent will eventually realize that what we are stating is the sole solution
i will explain why later on
therefore i do not wish to deviate from my point
if you wish to achieve your goal in the shortest and most efficient manner then lay the foundations of your nation in the manner i have described
the next point i wish to convey ladies and gentlemen is this we are faced with two questions
one pertains to the present and the other pertains to the future
as far as the present is concerned let me inform you of the stance of the muslim league
you are aware that a major conflict is occurring on more than one continent across the world
the british government is significantly involved in this war
rightly or wrongly based on the current situation and the constitution under which we are governed india is a belligerent nation
india at this moment is under british rule
consequently india is implicated in this war effort
therefore india must contribute all its possible efforts to intensify its war endeavor
no matter what our grievances and complaints against the british government might be we recognize that india is also in jeopardy
regardless of your personal sentiments and emotions you cannot disregard the central fact that india is also facing danger
for our own interests we cannot obstruct the war efforts being made to strengthen and enhance india s defense
we also do not wish to cause any hindrance to great britain
i am not advocating on behalf of the british government nor am i swayed by sentimental or emotional factors
with this in mind the muslim league was prepared to support and wholeheartedly cooperate with the british government provided that along with taking on the burden and responsibility we were also granted real and substantial authority within the existing constitutional framework
we asserted that muslim league representatives must possess genuine and significant authority within the government both at the central and provincial levels to genuinely and effectively contribute
how can we bear the responsibility and burden concerning the disposition of our people when we lack a voice in the government and cannot participate in the decision making about our army
how can we bear the responsibility and burden of managing millions and crores when we have no say and no share in the authority responsible for spending that money
how are we supposed to take up and fulfill that responsibility without the power and control within the government
the principle was even acknowledged by the british government and it s not disputed
however when it came to implementation lord linlithgow or mr
amery or perhaps both i am uncertain came forward with a trivial gesture saying we will give you two seats in the executive council without offering any further details laughter
this proposal from its very inception negated the principle and trivialized the substantial and wise foundation that had been laid down
as you are aware this offer could not be accepted by any responsible organization and was consequently rejected by the all india muslim league
that is all about the present
now let s move to the future
regarding the future ladies and gentlemen i have sincerely endeavored to give thorough attention devoid of any bias or prejudice and to the best of my ability i have examined the arguments against the lahore resolution
as far as we are concerned we stand by the lahore resolution and we want it to be realized as soon as circumstances permit or immediately after the war
that s our desire
our demand is not directed at hindus as the hindus did not encompass the entirety of india
muslims were the ones who ruled over india for years
it was the british who took india from the muslims
hence we are not asking hindus to concede anything to us
our demand is addressed to the british who are in control
it is utterly nonsensical to claim that hindustan belongs solely to hindus
they also assert that muslims were hindus at one time
these baseless arguments are presented by their leaders
they propose for instance that if an englishman converts to islam in england he does not demand pakistan
do you not have eyes to observe and minds to comprehend that an englishman upon changing his faith remains part of the same society with the same culture and social life
everything remains consistent when an englishman alters his religion
but can you not recognize that a muslim when converted even if it occurred more than a thousand years ago according to your hindu religion and philosophy becomes an outcaste and untouchable and hindus cease to engage with him socially religiously culturally or in any other aspect
he belongs to a distinct and separate order not just religiously but socially living in an entirely different and opposing social order religiously socially and culturally
it has been over a thousand years that the majority of muslims have lived within a distinct world a different society a different philosophy and a different faith
how can you compare this with the nonsensical notion that merely changing faith does not warrant a demand for pakistan
can you not see the fundamental difference
therefore i truly believe that no honest individual can feasibly contest the fact that muslims constitute a separate nation distinctly distinct from hindus
there are numerous hindus who genuinely believe this who have approached me and frequently expressed that the lahore resolution is the only viable solution
hence it is futile to argue this point any further
however how is the propaganda against it conducted
the propaganda is perpetuated and as i have mentioned i have endeavored to understand the arguments against it without any bias to the extent humanly possible
what are these arguments
i ll begin with mr
gandhi
he claims that it constitutes the vivisection of india
the term itself evokes a sense of horror
is it meant to frighten muslims away from committing the vivisection of india
or is it intended to scare hindus by suggesting that these unfortunate muslims are vivisecting their motherland
here s a question that arises from various queries
can you tell me when india was ever truly unified
was it ever united as one entity
why invoke the term vivisection
his disciple mr
rajagopalacharya takes it a step further and asserts starting by stating that it s like cutting a baby in two
to him i say my dear fellow where is this baby that is to be divided
he wasn t content with that and he thought it wasn t sufficient so he went further claiming that when two hindu brothers quarrel one desires to slice the mother cow into two halves
now ladies and gentlemen i ve always held profound respect for the religious sentiments of any community
however if a prominent politician of mr
rajagopalacharya s stature could undermine the feelings the religious feelings of hindus by utilizing this analogy that i intended to cut the mother cow in two it can only be described as a desperate attempt on their part when they lack any other compelling argument to present
then we were told that it goes against islam
ladies and gentlemen i am not a learned maulana or maulvi
i do not profess to possess expertise in theology
however i do possess some understanding of my faith and i am a modest yet proud adherent of my beliefs
i implore you in the name of all that is sacred how can this lahore resolution be deemed contrary to islam
in what way is it against islam
this argument has been put forth once again by a person of no lesser stature than mr
rajagopalacharya
next we are informed that it is not in the best interests of muslims themselves
to my hindu friends i say kindly do not concern yourselves with us
we sincerely thank you for highlighting what you perceive as our mistake and unwise decision and for telling us that it does not align with our interests
we are prepared to bear the consequences of our well thought out resolution
please take care of your own concerns
the following argument contends that the plan is economically impractical
i have been observing and i assure you i ve made an effort to read anything uttered by hindu leaders anywhere though i may have missed something i haven t come across any assertion except for the slogans that suggest that economically it is not a viable proposition
this is due to the claim that punjab is in financial ruin as is sind baluchistan is in a dire state and the north west frontier province is also in financial disarray
thus economically it s deemed unworkable
but why
can t you see that presently the primary source of revenue most of the revenue for this entire region rests with the central government
in the event of a partition in the presence of independent zones as we ve defined those regions would directly receive their own revenue without it passing through the central government as there would be no central government for india
why should this be a concern for you
in the worst case scenario as any rational person would we will manage our resources within our means
furthermore what about the hindu minorities in muslim zones
what about them
what are your suggestions
they do not offer any suggestions
and what about the muslim minority in hindu zones
as for that i have made a proposal
i propose that the hindu minority in muslim zones must be safeguarded fully as a minority
similarly the muslim minority in hindu zones should be fully protected as a minority
what do you suggest
do you suggest as an argument that because the hindu minorities in muslim zones will remain as minorities the million muslims should continue to be a minority in an artificial united india with a centralized government so that you can exert control over them even in zones where they constitute a solid majority
this is a nonsensical and misleading argument that is occasionally brought up
then we are told and this is not frequently mentioned that if india is divided then muslims will dominate the entire country and hindus will not be safe
my dear friends there will be at least million hindus in india if not more whereas the muslims in the north west zone and the eastern zone combined will not exceed million
are you truly apprehensive that these million muslims when allowed to function and develop freely and independently in their own homelands according to their own values laws culture social life and religion will somehow overrun the entire country
then may i pose this question how will you prevent the perceived threat of these million muslims running over the entire nation by maintaining a paper constitution of a united india
do you desire a paper constitution of united india while harboring million shall i say potentially dangerous individuals
is it your wish that the british government police a hindu dominated india allowing you to gradually and insidiously oppress the muslims with the assistance of british bayonets
is that what you truly desire
i ask my hindu friends and their leaders can you even conceive that the british people and the british nation would lower themselves to such an extent as to remain here and police your rule allowing you to suppress the muslims in this country through their bayonets
what is it that you truly desire
that is the question
so i say if hindus truly desire peace please scrutinize our proposals with objectivity and honesty
discard these slogans catchphrases and dramatic gestures they will not lead you anywhere
let us then calmly assess this situation acting as pragmatic individuals taking into account historical contexts and the various constitutions observed in different nations
i am convinced that partition would indeed be in the best interests of all parties involved not just muslims but hindus ruling princes and even the british
now having examined almost every argument that has been put forth thus far if we can reach an agreement on the partition of india let me assure you and i firmly believe backed by reason that muslims and hindus will coexist peacefully as friendly neighbors
i assure you and it seems self evident to me that muslim india will serve as the protective barrier for india s frontiers
do you believe for even a moment that afghanistan would allow iran to govern its territory
do you think that afghanistan or iran would permit turkey to rule over them
and do you think even within a relatively small region like arabia comprising sovereign states like yemen saudi arabia iraq and others that any of them would relinquish their independent territorial governance in favor of another
why must you assume that once muslims establish their own sovereign state in the north west zone someone else will be permitted to come and govern us as if they must rule over me before they rule over hindu india
hence muslim india will safeguard the frontiers and i hope that hindus will do the same for south and western india
together we shall stand as good friends and neighbors proclaiming to the world hands off india
this moment offers india an opportunity that if missed might not arise again for a long time
let us be practical confront realities and unite our efforts to find a solution to this predicament in line with the concept of pakistan
it is futile to threaten people or claim that the term pakistan is being misused by certain individuals
every intelligent person in this nation comprehends and grasps the essence of what we intend when we mention pakistan
if there is any troublemaker aiming to cause unrest only divine intervention can prevent them i cannot
anyone with intelligence and honesty understands exactly what we mean by pakistan we are referring to the lahore resolution
there is one more matter i would like to address and that concerns the sikh community
ladies and gentlemen it is somewhat perplexing to understand why some of our sikh friends harbor fears and concerns
i urge them to carefully and calmly consider this proposal
the position of the sikh community will be significantly better in the scenario we are suggesting the lahore resolution than their position in a united india under a federal constitution
isn t it evident that sikhs will form a significant community in the punjab
as an important community in the punjab won t they play a substantial role in the affairs of the province within any legislature established for punjab as one of the units of pakistan
won t they similarly contribute in the pakistan federation as a vital community within the province
what will their position be in the united india s federal constitution
they will be a mere fraction
this is true even today
let me convey to my sikh friends that even within the current legislature sikhs hold little sway
what impact can one member have among a hundred
how will one member fare when there are members and you have only two or three
in a united india framework not only will you have minimal representation but you will be insignificantly small within a vast arrangement
my sikh friends cannot escape the inescapable reality that they are a minority in the punjab and will continue to be one
quarreling threats or intimidation cannot overturn the fundamental fact that muslims constitute a majority in this region
i want to inform my sikh friends that if i believe their fears and apply them to my presidency then according to their concerns my position in my presidency where muslims are merely and the remaining nearly are hindus would be a hundred times worse
despite this i am not afraid
thus i implore people to genuinely assess these facts and weigh their pros and cons
there is one final point i would like to emphasize
it is evident that no federal constitution has ever been formulated or enacted without the voluntary agreement and consent of the constituent units entering into the federal arrangement
the only enduring solution for the muslims of india one that can withstand the test of time is the partition of india
this partition would allow both communities to develop freely and comprehensively according to their respective strengths economically socially culturally and politically
our struggle aims for the fullest opportunities and for the expression of the muslim national will
this critical contest in which we are engaged pertains not solely to material gain but also to the very essence of the muslim nation s existence
this is why i have repeatedly stated that this is a matter of life and death for the muslims and is not open to negotiation or bargaining
muslims have grown acutely aware of this reality
if we lose in this struggle everything is lost
let our motto be as the dutch proverb says money is lost nothing is lost courage is lost much is lost honor is lost most is lost soul is lost all is lost
